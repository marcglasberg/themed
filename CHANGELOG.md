## 8.0.2

* Version 8 and up are compatible with Flutter 3.27.0 and up. Note: Version 7.0.0 is
  not compatible with the new Flutter versions, but it will not throw any errors. It will
  just not work as expected. This means you MUST upgrade as soon as you upgrade your
  Flutter version:

  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    themed: ^8.0.1
  ``` 

## 7.0.0

* Theme change improvement: Now, when a theme is changed, it will make all color
  references different from themselves during exactly one frame. This will assure
  that all widgets that depend on the theme will be rebuilt with the new theme.
  While technically this is a breaking change, it's unlikely to affect you.

* `ColorRef.sameColor()` method to compare the current color of two `ColorRef` objects,
  or with a `Color` object. Note that the compared color is the effective one, that
  depend on the current theme.

* Fixed bug that affected Hot Reload.

## 5.1.1

* Added `Color.removeOpacity()` extension method.
  Note methods `addOpacity()`, `darker()`, `lighter()`, `average()` and `decolorize`
  already existed.
